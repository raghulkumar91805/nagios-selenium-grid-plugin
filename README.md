# nagios-selenium-grid-plugin

* This plugin uses the grid's console UI to extract busy and available sessions per browser type
* You can configure warn and critical levels using the `-w` and `-c` cli options, so if the busy precentage of at least one of the browser types being monitored exceed the limit it will be reflected in nagios
* You can add or remove browser types according to what you have in your selenium installation, elsewhere - the default will be used.
* It also tracks active running jenkins builds (aggregated per job), this info can help to correlate high activity in Jenkins with high activity in selenium
* The plugin is already configured to work with nagiosgraph, so you can see the data in a visalize way overtime

## Usage 
```
  usage: ./check_selenium_grid.sh -u http://seleniumserver:port/grid/console [-w warning_percentage] [-c critical_precentage] [-t browser_types_to_check] [-e http://jenkinsserver:port/jenkins] [-j jobs_to_monitor]
    -u  selenium grid console url
    -w  warn in case of '100 * busy sessions / all sessions + 1' of one of the browser types is greater than the entered value (precentage). default is: 70
    -c  error in case of '100 * busy sessions / all sessions + 1' of one of the browser types is greater than the entered value (precentage). default is: 95
    -t  browser types to check. We 'wc -l' on grep of 'browser_type.png' (fallback to 'browser_type</a>') from the console to find all sessions and after that 'wc -l' on grep of 'class=busy' for the busy ones. default is: chrome,firefox,internet_explorer
    -e  jenkins url
    -j  jenkins running jobs to monitor, we can use it to correlate high consumption in selenium grid with high activity in jenkins. the data presented is magnified by factor of 10 to have better visal correlation ability against selenium data. example for jobs list: jobA,jobB,jobC
    -h  display help
```

## Adding it into Nagios
Add a command to nagios, for example:

```
define command {
  command_name selenium_grid_active_sessions
  command_line /nagios/Server/etc/objects/check_selenium_grid.sh -u $ARG1$ -w $ARG2$ -c $ARG3$ -t $ARG4$ -e $ARG5$ -j $ARG6$
}
```

Add a service to nagios in localhost.cfg, for example:
```
define service{
    use                         generic-service-with-notify
    host_name                   localhost
    service_description         Check Selenium Grid Active Sessions
    check_command               selenium_grid_active_sessions!http://nagios_server:4444/grid/console!70!95!chrome,firefox,internet_explorer!http://jenkins_server:8888/jenkins!jobA,jobB
    check_interval              1
    contacts                    ci_admin
}
```

Restart nagios

You should see the new service under the localhost machine

watch the visulalized data in nagiosgraph

## It's a bash script, so you can use it even without nagios

Try something like this:
```
 while sleep 5; do date; ./check_selenium_grid.sh -u my_url; done
 ```
